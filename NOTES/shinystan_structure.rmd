## Code structures

### What to work with?

Always assume that in the global environment you have a [shinystan object](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinystan/shinystan.pdf). All manipulations are done with respect to this object. 

### What to build with?

Throughout shinystan we will build all separate pieces using [moduels](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html).
